# heroku-error-pages
These are the default heroku error pages without the branding

This repo simply hosts the default Heroku error pages without the branding that they normally include so you can use them on your apps without the unprofessional look.

The designs of these pages are owned solely by Heroku. I will take this repository down if they contact me to do so.
